## Lasso

We analyse the browsing and online purchasing behaviour of households using Comscoreâ€™s web browser data. More precisely, we  use a Lasso with only two active control variables  in order to find which two webpages are together the best linear predictors for online spendings in 2006. 

## Final Project

The aim is to predict the sale prices of new houses based on their characteristics. We use three different estimation approaches, namely OLS, LASSO and Ridge and compare their performances (through the out of sample MSE). LASSO significantly outperformed the other two methods.
